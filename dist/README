This directory contains source copies of some small utilities we use to 
communicate with the outside world.

The reason we keep a copy of these utilities in the tree is to reduce the chance
that installing them via the network will timeout and/or otherwise fail; we want
to be able to communicate build status (externally from the CI provider) as
early as possible, so, in effect, as long as we've been able to clone the two
sensu repos (sensu-go and sensu-release), we hopefully should be able to "call
out" to the world, without depending on any third parties (other than Amazon,
of course!)
